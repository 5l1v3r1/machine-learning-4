# MongoDB Cluster

This module is not intended for horizontally scaling, with the intention for
 distributed computing, such as big data. Instead, this module demonstrates
 that this application will work on a trivial case, on a sharded / replicated
 mongodb cluster implementation. It is important to keep in mind, this is only
 a vagrant contained virtual machine, used for development purposes.
