The development ecosystem for this application, can be run via |docker-compose|_.
This allows various respective docker containers, to be managed consistently.
However, before proceeding, it is important to follow the |docker|_ , and
|docker-compose|_ installation guide.

Once docker-compose has installed, simply run ``docker-compose up``. This will
allow the application to be accessible via https://localhost:8080 on the host
machine.
