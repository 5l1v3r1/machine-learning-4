In `machine learning<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`, support
 vector machine (SVMs), and support vector regression (SVRs) are `supervised learning<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning>`
 models with associated learning `algorithms<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>`
 that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for `classification<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification>`
 and `regression analysis<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis>`.  More
 generally, machine-learning deals with the construction and study of systems
 that can `learn<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning>` from data, rather than
 follow only explicitly programmed instructions.

Applications for machine learning include:

- `Object recognition<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition>`
- `Natural language processing<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`
- `Search engines<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engines>`
- `Bioinformatics<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics>`
- `Stock market<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market>` analysis
- `Speech<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition>` and `handwriting recognition<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition>`
- `Sentiment analysis<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis>`
- `Recommender systems<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system>`
- `Sequence mining<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_mining>`, commonly
 referred as *data mining*
